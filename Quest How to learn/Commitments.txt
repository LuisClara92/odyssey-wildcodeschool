'Hello World' 
Like everything started in a dev's life.

Once up on time, I decide chance my routes...
Everything began with a laptop, a pen and paper.
Write simple things and thoughts. Some ideas are very strong, 
others never imagine, but the best part is the definicion of some points.
Points that consist and persist until now.
Some I can't show you, but I think this five I can ;)

My learning profile is dynamic, enthusiast and perfectionist.
My test results are 57 % Visual(profil principal)
and of 29 % Auditory(main style).

1) Every day, have some time too myself and too my family,
we can talk about everything like work, holidays or projects weekend,
but most importantly talk about some troubles and problems.
We try to resolve them as a team.

2) Two days per week, is exercice time either at the gym or at home in our
private gym, sports are very important to clear mind and body.
And make us feel good :D 

3) Every saturday, do a resume of week in my 'Lego' notebook.. 
Every new concepts and some future projects. Listen all my classmates
and my teachers, will improve my soft skills.. And the way too do it is
reading our on resume about the week.
